This is my cheat sheet

pwd: tells where you are in the filestream
touch: create file 
echo: echo input information 
ls: list of contents of chosen directory
ls -l: file permissions 
chmod +x (file name): give permission to execute
cd: change directory 
cd ~: change directory to home folder
cd ..: go back (up) one 
up arrow: copy command from previous line
cat: check for text in file
>: redirect
|: take the output of one command and use it as input for another
