## Reviewing What We've Learned So Far 
- - -


-  Moving Beyond GUI (Graphical User Interface)
    - Information on a computer is organized hierarchically 
    - Folders are also known as 'directories', and each file in a folder has its own 'address.' Ex. /Users/emmaraupp/path. 
    - When you navigate the web, you are actually visiting different addresses and connecting to different browsers. Ex. http://somedomain.org/path.
    - File extensions: .pdf, .jpg, .docx, .txt, .md, .html
    - Plain Text Files: lightweight, cross-platform, easily translated and accessible to all (unlike rich text).
    - Markdown: simplified symbolic formatting for plain  text
    - CSS: language for assigning styling to markup (ex. a heading is indicated by HTML, and CSS translates how that heading appears in terms of size, color, font, etc.)

- Elements of HTML Statements
    - p for paragraph
    - img src for images
    - h1 or h2 for headings
    - a href for links
